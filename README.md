# StudyNotion

StudyNotion is a fully functional ed-tech platform that enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERN stack.


## System Architecture 

The StudyNotion ed-tech platform consists of three main components: the front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.

### Frontend 

The front end of StudyNotion has the following pages:

#### For Students:

- Homepage: This page has a brief introduction to the platform, as well as links to the course list and user details.
- Course List: This page has a list of all the courses available on the platform, along with their descriptions and ratings.
- Wishlist: This page displays all the courses a student has added to their wishlist.
- Cart Checkout: This page allows the user to complete the course purchase.

- User Details: This page has details about the student's account, including their name, email, and other relevant information.
- User Edit Details: This page allows students to edit their account details.

#### For Instructors:

- Dashboard: This page has an overview of the instructor's courses, as well as the ratings and feedback for each course.
- Insights: This page has detailed insights into the instructor's courses, including the number of views, clicks, and other relevant metrics.
- Course Management Pages: These pages allow the instructor to create, update, and delete courses, as well as manage the course content and pricing.

### Backend

StudyNotion uses a monolithic architecture, with the backend built using Node.js and Express.js, and MongoDB as the primary database.

#### Features and Functionalities of the Back-end:

- User authentication and authorization: Students and instructors can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses and password. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.
- Course management: Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and media. Students can view and rate courses.
- Payment Integration: Students will purchase and enroll on courses by completing the checkout flow that is followed by Razorpay integration for payment handling.
- Cloud-based media management: StudyNotion uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and documents.
- Markdown formatting: Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, which allows for easier display and rendering on the front end.
